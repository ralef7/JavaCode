proFinal README

This was a final project for Intermediate Java where I extended base code provided by University of Chicago's Professor
Gerber.  A basic controller, Sprite model, Movable interface and a few of the other basic models were provided to be
built upon.  This project is a multithreaded java swing application.  It helped me build comfort with object oriented
design, polymorphism, inheritance and encapsulation.  Also, the game turned out to be pretty fun.
