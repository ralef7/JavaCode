proFinal README

This was a final project for Intermediate Java where I extended base code provided by University of Chicago's Professor
Gerber.  A basic controller, Sprite model, Movable interface and a few of the other basic models were provided to be
built upon.  This project is a multithreaded java swing application.  It helped me build comfort with object oriented
design, polymorphism, inheritance and encapsulation.  Also, the game turned out to be pretty fun.

To run the game and easily view the code, import this project into intellij or some other IDE.  Once it is imported, open
 the controller and run Game.java.  This will begin the game. Follow the instructions on the front screen to play.
